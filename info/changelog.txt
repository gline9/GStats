V-0.1.0: Unofficial Release
Released:03/30/2016
**Libraries**
GCorev0.1.8.1

  --  Includes a sample class for creating samples rapidly, the sample class also provides
      constructors so you can efficiently copy a sample and create a sample from an unordered
      array list.
      
  --  Added a sample statistics class so you can compute the most basic statistics about samples.
      
  --  Added two basic plots for the sample class, the histogram plot and the box plot.
  
  
V-0.1.1: Sample Bug Fix Update
Released: 04/01/2016
**Libraries**
GCorev0.2.1

  --  Fixed a bug where there could be more elements in a sample than were in the array list when using
      the array list constructor.
      
      
V-0.1.2: Random Number Generator Update
Released: 04/08/2016
**Libraries**
GCorev0.2.1

  --  Added random number generators for all of the most common distributions in statistics these
      include the Normal, Uniform, Poisson, Exponential, ChiSquared, T, Cauchy, F and many more 
      distributions.
  
  --  Optimized the process of outlier removal from a sample by adding the removeSmallest and
      removeLargest methods to the sample class.
      
  --  Added a util class for random number generators that let's you apply a function to any of the random
      number generators to make a new one, this can be used to make more complicated distributions.
